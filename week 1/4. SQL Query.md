Let's dissect this [[2. SQL]] query
```SQL
SELECT host FROM listings;
```

- **SELECT**
This is the main operation that we want to perform. `SELECT` represent fetching specific information from the DB. There is other operation like `DELETE` & `UPDATE`
- **host**
Specific column that we want to fetch
- **FROM**
SQL keyword that will select the table we want to fetch the data after this `FROM` keyword
- **listings** 
Name of the table

We can select multiple column like this
```SQL
SELECT listing, host, room_type FROM listings;
```
or we can select all column with wildcard or asterisk symbol
```SQL
SELECT * FROM listings;
```
## Compliment from SELECT operation
- **LIMIT**
this operation will *limit* number of rows returned by the `SELECT` operation. Here is the example of limiting only three entity from listings table
```SQL
SELECT * FROM listings LIMIT 3
```
> Limit is the upper bound so if the table have entity below the limit, it will return all of that value
- **ORDER BY**
The query returned by `SELECT` operation is show up in no particular order. However we can set it to return in particular order by calling `ORDER BY` clause. Here is an example of we want to select all data from listings table but sorted by their price and then we limit top 5 cheapest listings
```SQL
SELECT * FROM listings ORDER BY price_in_dollar LIMIT 5;
```
By default `ORDER BY` will sort ascendingly (from small to big). If we want to reverse it / descendingly (big to small) we can call `DESC` clause after the column name like this
```SQl
SELECT * FROM LISTINGS ORDER BY price_in_dollar DESC LIMIT 5;
```
It will show the top 5 most expensive listings
Last but not least, if we want to order the data by multiple columns, we can just specify these as a comma-separated list like this
```SQL
SELECT * FROM LISTINGS ORDER BY price_in_dollar, host LIMIT 10;
```
Note the order of preference on the sort is from left to right so it'll first sort by `price_in_dollar` and then inside that by `host`
- **DISTINCT**
Sometime a column has value repeated. So if we want to `SELECT` operation return all the distinct values of that column we need to use `DISTINCT` clause. Here is an example
```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT room_type FROM listings;
```
If we want unique rows that are a combination of multiple columns, we can just add them in a comma-separated manner
```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT neighbourhood_id, room_type FROM listings;
```
Remember that the database will return unique combinations of all the columns mentioned. So the query above returns unique (`neighbourhood_id, room_type`) pairs
