- **Table** 
Single table generally represent data about single object. In AirBnB example, a table could be users, listings, booking, etc. We can think a table is a single spreadsheet on MS Excel
- **Database**
Collection of tables that might be linked together via some defined relationship. 
- **Query**
Piece of SQL code that the database will process and take action on. 
## Table Schemas
A table have its own structure that is called **schema** that define **name** of the column and those column **data type**. A table could have many different **entity** that will have filled all column information. Here is an example of table **listings** with its 3 entity

| listing_id | listing | host_id | host| nb_id | price |
| --- | --- |---| --- | ---| ----|
| 574105250645 | Peaceful 1 Bedroom Apartment |109067745|Andrew|35|150

| 11970913 | Central and Sunny Room |37772146|Hannah|32|58
The schema of a table does not change very often and is usually a heavy-duty activity for a database. In a production database, rows are constantly added, updated, or deleted based on the application. The following image shows the entire database schema for our mini Airbnb datase
