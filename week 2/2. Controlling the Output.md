We can control our output by altering some values so it will be easier to understand the result of the query. Here is some of the way we can control our [[2. SQL]] output.
## Renaming Output Column Names
We can rename our column name for the output using `AS` clause. In one of our example in `listings`table, we have one column label as `host` that was filled the host name. It can cause ambiguity so we can change the label `host` to `host_name` like this
```SQL
-- BEFORE renaming 
SELECT host_id, host FROM listings LIMIT 5; 
-- AFTER renaming to make it easier to understand 
SELECT host_id, host AS host_name FROM listings LIMIT 5;
```
One thing to note is `AS` clause only change the output not altering the table or the column name directly.
## Apply Arithmetics
We can apply Arithmetics to our column mainly with the `number` data type. In one of our example in `listings` table, we have column label as `price_in_dollar` which show the price in USD. If we want to show it on AUD, we can multiply those value with nowadays change rate (1 USD = 1.55 AUD as 4-9-2023).
```SQL
SELECT 
	listing_id, 
	price_in_dollar, 
	price_in_dollar * 1.59 AS price_in_aud 
FROM listings LIMIT 5;
```
Other example using temperature converter from celcius to fahrenheit
```SQL
SELECT
   measurement_date,
   temp_in_celsius,
   (temp_in_celsius * 1.8) + 32 AS temp_in_fahrenheit
FROM weather LIMIT 5;
```
