When we presenting data we need to aggregate what's in our data. Here is some of our way we can aggregate our data
## Computing Statistics
Here we aggregate information using computing statistic like maximum or minimum value, average, sum, and count. 
- `SUM`: calculate the sum across the different rows
- `COUNT`: number of entries in this column
- `AVG`: average of all values in this column
- `MIN`: minimum of all values in this column
- `MAX`: maximum of all values in this column
To know the value of all that, we operate them as function like in this example that search maximum, minimum, and average of listings price
```SQL
SELECT
   MAX(price_in_dollar) AS 'maximum price',
   MIN(price_in_dollar) AS 'minimum price',
   AVG(price_in_dollar) AS 'average price'
FROM listings;
```
What we need to remember is all of that computing statistic clause only works with **numerical value** except `COUNT`. Its because `COUNT` will **count number of entries** in selected column **that is not `NULL`.** Because of that, if we want to count all rows on that table, we can use `COUNT(*)` that is generally used for counting rows without ignoring NULL values. Like in this example where we want count how many products have 17 on the price
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM Products
WHERE Price = 18;
```

## Group By
Combing  `GROUP BY()` with computing statistics allow us to compute statistic data with respect something like some of this scenario
- Instead of finding total revenue of all time ➡️ finding revenue per quarter
- Instead of finding the average price of listing across all listings ➡️ finding the average price of listing per neighborhood
- Instead of finding the total number of students on Uplimit ➡️ finding the number of students for each course
  
> **TL;DR** - Whenever you see yourself saying "Per / For Each" that's your signal that you might need a GROUP BY in your SQL query

Lets start with an example from finding the average price of listing per neighborhood
```SQL
SELECT 
	neighbourhood_id, -- Get the neighbourhood Id 
	AVG(price_in_dollar) AS avg_price -- Average price of a listing 
FROM listings GROUP BY neighbourhood_id -- Compute the statistics per neighbourhood_id 
ORDER BY neighbourhood_id -- Order neighbourhood Id
```

Another example where we count number of listings in each neighborhood_id
```SQL
SELECT
    neighbourhood_id,
    COUNT(*) AS num_listings
FROM listings
GROUP BY neighbourhood_id
```

### Multi columns
We can use `GROUP BY()` on multi column scenario. In this example we want to Retrieve the average price of a room type in a neighbourhood, ordered by the neighbourhood_id and then the room_type.
```SQL
SELECT 
	neighbourhood_id, 
	room_type, 
	AVG(price_in_dollar) AS avg_price 
FROM listings 
GROUP BY neighbourhood_id, room_type -- Group by both neighbourhood_id and room_type 
ORDER BY neighbourhood_id, room_type
```

### Order By
Using `ORDER BY()` clause can help us order statistics table alongside any of the other columns. For example if we want to know where is the most expensive neighborhood(based on the average) for each room type (jadi cari area paling mahal untuk setiap room type)
```SQL
SELECT
   neighbourhood_id,
   room_type,
   AVG(price_in_dollar) AS avg_price
FROM listings
GROUP BY neighbourhood_id, room_type
ORDER BY room_type, avg_price DESC
```

### Filtering Information
We can use `WHERE` clause with the `GROUP BY`.  Here is the example same in the example in Order By  example but we want to filter out `Hotel room`
```SQL
SELECT
   neighbourhood_id,
   room_type,
   AVG(price_in_dollar) AS avg_price
FROM listings
WHERE room_type != 'Hotel room'
GROUP BY neighbourhood_id, room_type
ORDER BY room_type ASC, avg_price DESC
```
> `WHERE` is written before `GROUP BY`

The flow of the query is start from the database will filter using `WHERE` clause. After that `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` is executed. 
Last but not least, we can use `LIMIT` clause after the `GROUP BY` or if there is any `ORDER BY` clause then it will be put after the `ORDER BY` clause.
## Having vs Where
If we want to filter neighbourhoods that have an average price per listing > 300 and try to run this query, it will throw an error
```SQl
-- NOTE: This will throw an error ❌ 
SELECT 
	neighbourhood_id, 
	AVG(price_in_dollar) AS avg_price 
FROM listings 
WHERE avg_price > 300 
GROUP BY neighbourhood_id
```
The error happen because `WHERE` clause doesn't work on aggregated data. Instead, `WHERE` clause work on raw information that passed for the aggregation. To handle that we use `HAVING` clause after the `GROUP BY` like this
```SQL
SELECT 
    neighbourhood_id,
    AVG(price_in_dollar) AS avg_price
FROM listings
GROUP BY neighbourhood_id
HAVING avg_price > 300
```
We can conclude that
- `WHERE` clause used to filter information **before** any aggregation happen
- `HAVING` clause used to filter **the result** of aggregation
## Exercise
> find the difference between the average and the minimum price (_avg - min_) for each room type per neighbourhood after removing any listing with price that is greater than $1000

Solution
```SQL
SELECT
   neighbourhood_id,
   room_type,
   AVG(price_in_dollar) - MIN(price_in_dollar) AS price_difference
FROM listings
WHERE price_in_dollar < 1000
GROUP BY neighbourhood_id, room_type
```

> 1. find out the price range and the number of restaurants that match that price range

Solution for number 1
```SQL
SELECT
    price_range,
    COUNT(price_range) AS num_restaurants
FROM restaurants
GROUP BY price_range
```
