In SQL we can use If else like in any programming language. However, the clause is and the form is different. In SQL we use `CASE WHEN`
## Case Statement
We use example for the `CASE` statement. Let say we have column label as `price_in_dollar`. We want to split the that price into some ranges  `$,$$,$$$`. Here is the query to do that
```MySQL
SELECT 
	listing_id, price_in_dollar, 
	CASE 
		WHEN price_in_dollar < 120 THEN '$' 
		WHEN price_in_dollar >= 120 AND price_in_dollar < 300 THEN '$$' 
		ELSE '$$$'
	END AS price_tiers 
FROM listings 
LIMIT 10
```
Some takes
- `CASE` will start the statement
- `END` The end marker of `CASE` statement
- `WHEN [condition] THEN [value]` If the condition is met the output will be the value (The output will be the first `WHEN` that is met the condition)
- `ELSE` default output if there is no `WHEN [condition]` that is met

Other case to use `CASE WHEN` are filtering out some outlier by cap it like in this query
```MySQL
SELECT
    listing_id,
    price_in_dollar,
    CASE
        WHEN price_in_dollar > 1000 THEN 1000
        ELSE price_in_dollar
    END AS capped_price
FROM listings
ORDER BY price_in_dollar DESC
LIMIT 10
```
### Using Case Statement inside Group By
We can use the result from `CASE` statement inside `GROUP BY` statement. Back to the first example that categorize pricing. Supposed that we want to count how many listing on each category price, we can run this query
```MySQL
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN price_in_dollar < 120 THEN '$'
        WHEN price_in_dollar >= 120 AND price_in_dollar < 300 THEN '$$'
        ELSE '$$$'
    END AS price_tiers,
    COUNT(listing_id)
FROM listings
GROUP BY price_tiers
```
## Pivot using Case
With `CASE` statement we can pivot our data
> `Pivot` is an operation that rotates a table-valued expression by turning the unique values from one column in the expression into multiple columns in the output (Definition by [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/from-using-pivot-and-unpivot?view=sql-server-ver16))

Here is an example using `CASE` to make a pivot.
> We want to know how many each room type on each neighborhood

**First step** is making the pivot from column `room_type` using `CASE`. Here is the query
```MySQL
SELECT
    listing_id,
    neighbourhood_id,
    CASE WHEN room_type='Entire home/apt' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_entire_apt,
    CASE WHEN room_type='Private room' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_private_room,
    CASE WHEN room_type='Hotel room' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_hotel
FROM listings
```
**Final step** is some all of the case then using `GROUP BY` on the column `neighborhood_id`. Here is the query
```MySQL
SELECT
    neighbourhood_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN room_type='Entire home/apt' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num_entire_apt,
    SUM(CASE WHEN room_type='Private room' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num_private_room,
    SUM(CASE WHEN room_type='Hotel room' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num_hotel
FROM listings
GROUP BY neighbourhood_id
```

## Exercise
We want to categorize restaurant based on the number of review here is the query
```MySQL
SELECT
    restaurant,
    CASE
        WHEN num_reviews = 0 OR num_reviews IS NULL THEN 'New'
        WHEN num_reviews <=100 THEN 'Low Reviews'
        WHEN num_reviews <=500 THEN 'Moderate Reviews'
        WHEN num_reviews > 500 THEN 'Many Reviews'
    END AS review_category
FROM restaurants
```
