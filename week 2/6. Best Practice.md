Here is some of the good and bad practice syntax writing on SQL
1. **SQL Keyword / clause**
Try to always using uppercase when using SQL keyword like `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `AS`
2. **Column Names**
Use lowercase and snake case for the column names. Here is some of the example
```MySQL
first_name -- GOOD 
FIRST_NAME -- BAD 
firstName -- BAD 
First_Name -- BAD
```
3. **Aliasing**
When we want to present any column name is better using `AS` keyword to rename the column label name 
```MySQL
SELECT room_type AS Room Type
```
4. **Left Align**
Left Align any SQL keyword like `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`
```MySQL
SELECT 
	listing_id, 
	price_in_dollar 
FROM listings
WHERE neighbourhood_id = '20' 
	AND price_in_dollar > '80' 
LIMIT 10
```
5. **Comments**
We can use any comment using double dash `--` to explain something
6. **Readability**
Focus on how our query is easy to read because query most likely will be read 10x times than it is written
